What's So Special About the Magic Number 6174? 

The number '6174' looks like any other ordinary number but what if I told you this is a magic number? Would you believe me? 
6174 is known as kaprekarâ€™s constant as it was invented by Indian mathematician DR Kaprekar in 1949. 
Even mathematicians, till date, aren't sure how to explain this magic number. Wondering, what's so unique about the number? This number is known for the rule as following: 
1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed). 
2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary. 
3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. 
4. Go back to step 2 and repeat. 

It was only in 1970 that people started recognizing Kaprekar's work after America's bestselling author, Martin Gardner wrote an article on Kaprekar in a magazine titled
'Scientific America'. Today, Kaprekar's contribution in the field of mathematics is known to the entire world.
